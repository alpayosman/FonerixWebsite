        <h2>Our Strategy</h2>
        <p>We specialize in mapping out Turkey’s most promising retail landscapes, helping our partner brands position themselves where success is most likely.
          Instead of limiting ourselves to product distribution, we provide strategic guidance — from location selection to market entry — ensuring each store opens in a zone with strong commercial potential.
          By combining deep local knowledge with reliable wholesale execution, we act as both advisor and operator in your growth journey.</p>

        <h2>Our Plans</h2>
        <p>
          Our short-term priority is to establish a flagship showroom in Istanbul — Turkey’s largest and most competitive retail hub. With its high demand, 
          dense premium shopping zones, and intense foot traffic, Istanbul offers unmatched potential for growth. Leveraging our local insights into high-performing areas, 
          we plan to guide our partners toward impactful market positioning. 
          From this base, we aim to expand into other key cities, combining strategic retail planning with strong collaborations to build both flagship stores and 
          a robust wholesale network that aligns with global trends and local demand. 
          We believe that positioning ourselves in the heart of Istanbul will not only strengthen brand visibility but also serve as a launchpad for nationwide expansion. 
          Our goal is to create lasting value for our partners through a well-planned and adaptable growth strategy.

</h3>
      <p>Buckhead was founded in 2018, inspired by the vibrant Buckhead district of Atlanta — a renowned center for fashion and style. 
        The brand initially gained recognition with its high-quality European-made snow boots for children, 
        and has since expanded its collection to include sneakers, sandals, and winter footwear for all ages, blending comfort with trend-driven design.</p>

      <p>As Fonerix, we played a key role in Buckhead’s expansion into the UK market, supporting its visibility across top e-commerce platforms like Amazon. 
        Today, Buckhead continues to grow its presence both in Turkey and abroad, 
        staying in tune with next-generation trends while making its mark in competitive global markets.</p>

      <p>
        Founded by Hayrettin Taşkıran, Bereket Döner blends the authentic flavor of traditional Turkish döner with modern production techniques. 
        By establishing the world’s largest döner production facility in Istanbul, the brand has elevated döner quality and become a key player in popularizing it both in Turkey 
        and globally.</p>
        <p>
          As Fonerix, we supported Bereket Döner’s strategic expansion into Antalya by helping secure high-traffic branch locations. 
          This collaboration has strengthened the brand’s presence in one of Turkey’s most competitive regional markets.
